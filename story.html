            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>
              Christopher Edward Nolan was born on July 30, 1970, in
              Westminster, London. His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a
              British advertising executive of Irish descent, working as a
              creative director. His mother, Christina Jensen, originally from
              Evanston, Illinois, was an American flight attendant who later
              became an English teacher. Nolan has two brothers: an elder
              brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, who is also a
              filmmaker. The three brothers were raised Catholic in Highgate,
              and they would spend their summers in Evanston. Nolan also lived
              in Chicago during his youth and holds dual citizenship in both the
              UK and the US. <br />
              <br />

              Nolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an
              independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later
              studied English literature at University College London (UCL).
              Opting out of a traditional film education, he pursued "a degree
              in something unrelated", which his father suggested "gives a
              different take on things". He chose UCL specifically for its
              filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite
              and 16 mm film cameras. Nolan was president of the Union's Film
              Society, and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he
              screened feature films in 35mm during the school year and used the
              money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers.
            </p>

            <h2>1993–2003: Early career and breakthrough</h2>

            <p>
              After earning his bachelor's degree in English literature in 1993,
              Christopher Nolan worked as a script reader, camera operator, and
              director of corporate and industrial films. In 1996, he directed,
              wrote, and edited the short film Larceny, a black-and-white
              project shot over a weekend with limited equipment and a small
              cast and crew. Funded by Nolan himself and using equipment from
              UCL's Union Film Society, Larceny premiered at the Cambridge Film
              Festival and is regarded as one of UCL's best short films. For
              unknown reasons, the film has since been removed from public
              circulation.
              <br /><br />

              In 1997, Nolan directed Doodlebug, a short film about a man
              chasing what he believes is an insect, only to find that it is a
              miniature version of himself. This creative piece further
              solidified his reputation for innovative and thought-provoking
              storytelling.
              <br /><br />

              In the mid-1990s, Christopher Nolan and his wife, Emma Thomas,
              made their first attempt at creating a feature film titled Larry
              Mahoney, but they ultimately scrapped the project. During this
              phase of his career, Nolan faced significant challenges in getting
              his projects off the ground, encountering numerous rejections. He
              reflected on the difficulties of securing funding, particularly in
              the British film industry, saying, "There's a very limited pool of
              finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place
              ... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film
              industry." Despite these early setbacks, Nolan's perseverance
              eventually led to his breakthrough with films like Following and
              Memento, which launched his career on an international stage.
              <br /><br />

              After completing his earlier projects, Christopher Nolan wrote a
              screenplay for a biopic on Howard Hughes. However, he decided to
              shelve the script upon discovering that Martin Scorsese was
              already working on a similar project, which would become The
              Aviator (2004). Nolan then became briefly attached to direct an
              adaptation of Ruth Rendell's novel The Keys to the Street for Fox
              Searchlight Pictures but chose to direct Batman Begins instead.
              <br /><br />

              In the same period, Nolan turned down an offer to direct the
              historical epic Troy (2004). A notable incident occurred in April
              2003, when filmmaker David O. Russell put Nolan in a headlock at a
              Hollywood party after learning that Jude Law, whom Russell wanted
              to cast, had chosen to work with Nolan instead. Russell pressured
              Nolan to display "artistic solidarity" by relinquishing Law from
              his cast. Despite the confrontation, Nolan continued his path
              toward Batman Begins, which redefined the superhero genre.
            </p>

            <h2>2003–2013: Widespread recognition</h2>

            <p>
              In early 2003, Christopher Nolan approached Warner Bros. with the
              idea of rebooting the Batman franchise by focusing on the
              character’s origin story. He was drawn to the concept of grounding
              the film in a more realistic, relatable world, rather than
              adhering to the typical comic-book fantasy. During the production
              of Batman Begins (2005), Nolan prioritized traditional stunts and
              practical effects, using minimal CGI to maintain the grounded tone
              he envisioned. Batman Begins was the largest project Nolan had
              undertaken at the time, and upon its release, it received critical
              acclaim and achieved significant commercial success. Starring
              Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, alongside Michael Caine,
              Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film
              successfully revived the Batman franchise. It became the
              ninth-highest-grossing film of 2005 and was praised for its
              psychological depth and contemporary relevance. <br /><br />

              Film author Ian Nathan noted that within five years, Nolan had
              progressed from being an indie filmmaker to gaining creative
              control over one of Hollywood's biggest properties, contributing
              to the evolution of the superhero genre that would later dominate
              the film industry.

          <h2>2014–2019: Interstellar, Dunkirk and other activities</h2>
          <p>
            Christopher Nolan next directed, wrote, and produced the
            science-fiction epic Interstellar (2014). The first drafts of the
            script were written by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, and the project
            was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Inspired by
            the scientific theories of renowned theoretical physicist Kip
            Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a
            wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. Nolan, in discussing
            the film's physics, expressed his deep respect for scientific
            objectivity and wished that such an approach would be applied
            universally in society. The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne
            Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain and was a major box office success,
            grossing $773 million worldwide. <br /><br />

            Interstellar received widespread praise for its "visual dazzle" and
            "thematic ambition." The New York Times's A.O. Scott described it as
            a "sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread, and
            regret." Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers lauded it as "a real work
            of art," commending its multi-generational story arc. The film's
            scientific accuracy was especially noted, and it even led to the
            publication of two academic papers. The American Journal of Physics
            suggested that Interstellar be shown in school science lessons due
            to its accurate depiction of theoretical physics. At the 87th
            Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four
            other nominations. <br /><br />

            In 2014, Nolan and his wife, Emma Thomas, also served as executive
            producers on Transcendence, the directorial debut of Nolan's
            longtime cinematographer, Wally Pfister. Around the same time, Nolan
            engaged in several ventures for film preservation and distribution.
            His production company, Syncopy, formed a joint venture with
            Zeitgeist Films to release Blu-ray editions of their works. As part
            of this partnership, Nolan directed the documentary short Quay
            (2015), which explored the work of the animation filmmakers, the
            Brothers Quay.
          </p>

          <h2>2020–present: Tenet and Oppenheimer</h2>
          <p>
            Christopher Nolan's next film, Tenet (2020), was a science fiction
            thriller described by Tom Shone of The Sunday Times as "a
            globe-spinning riff on all things Nolanesque." Nolan had spent more
            than five years working on the screenplay after contemplating its
            central ideas for over a decade. The film's release was delayed
            three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it ultimately became
            the first major Hollywood tent-pole to debut in theaters after the
            pandemic shutdown. The story revolves around an unnamed protagonist,
            played by John David Washington, who travels through time to prevent
            a global catastrophe. <br /><br />

            Despite grossing $363 million worldwide on a production budget of
            $200 million, Tenet underperformed at the box office relative to
            Nolan's previous works, in part due to the pandemic's impact on
            theaters. The film received polarizing reactions from critics. Many
            praised its technical achievements and ambition but found the plot
            confusing and difficult to follow. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian
            gave it a perfect score, calling it "a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan
            flourish of crazy implausibility—but supercharged with steroidal
            energy and imagination." On the other hand, Leslie Felperin of The
            Hollywood Reporter described the film as "a chilly, cerebral
            film—easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and
            originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a
            certain humanity." <br /><br />

            At the 93rd Academy Awards, Tenet won Best Visual Effects and was
            nominated for Best Production Design. Following the release of
            Tenet, Nolan joined the Advisory Board of the Society of Motion
            Picture and Television Engineers. In 2021, he served as an executive
            producer on Zack Snyder's Justice League, the director’s cut of the
            2017 film Justice League. This collaboration further solidified his
            influence in both filmmaking and film preservation efforts.
